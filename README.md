# Bank Customer Churn Analysis for ALY 6015

## Course Project Overview
This repository hosts my final project for the ALY 6015 - Intermediate Analytics course at Northeastern University. The project aims to analyze and predict customer churn for a credit card company, utilizing a dataset that includes customer profiles and their churn status. By applying various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and regularization techniques, we aim to uncover the significant predictors of customer churn.

## Dataset Overview
The project uses the "Churn Modeling" dataset, which comprises details about bank customers' profiles and their churn status, labeled as "Exited". Key features include demographics, account details, and activity metrics, which are instrumental in predicting churn.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure and key characteristics.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Testing assumptions about the data and its features to guide further analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Development of predictive models using linear and logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of customer churn.
- **Decision Trees and Regularization Techniques:** Employing decision trees to visualize decision paths and applying Lasso and Ridge regression techniques to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting.
- **Key Insights:** Identification of significant predictors for churn, such as age, geography, and account activity, and recommendations for targeted strategies to mitigate churn.
